## Building on our C-plorations

First, complete all C-plorations 1 through 10. Copy your files from C-ploration 10 over to your Project6 folder.

To summarize, we have the following files:

- main.c
- parser.c and parser.h
- symtable.c and symtable.h
- error.c and error.h
- hack.h

## Running the Assembler
To run the assembler, follow these steps:

1. Make the file with make.
2. Run it with ./main ./filepath/asmfile.asm
